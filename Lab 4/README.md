Project name: Wave & Snack: A Gesture-Controlled Snack Box


For lab this week, we focus on both sensing and actuation, bringing new modes of input and output into your devices, while also prototyping the physical structure and overall look of the device. You will consider how the physical form supports sensing and actuation, and how these elements come together to shape the interaction and aesthetics of the device.




### Part D

**\*\*\*Draw 5 sketches that explore different physical arrangements for your sensing and actuation.\*\*\***

![Five Sketches for Feast Automata](./lab4.jpg)


### Sketch 1: Wave to Open a Snack Box

This design allows users to open a snack box by waving their hands. A gesture sensor is placed on the front of the box to detect hand movements. A servo motor is attached to the side of the box to control the lid. When the user waves their hand, the servo rotates to open the lid, allowing them to grab a snack.

### Sketch 2: Hand-Activated Candy Dispenser

This design allows users to get candy without pressing any buttons. A distance sensor is placed near the bottom of the box to detect when a hand is underneath. A servo motor is installed inside the box to control a small gate. When a hand is detected, the servo opens the gate to release candy into the user's hand.

### Sketch 3: Touch-Activated Water Pourer

This design allows users to pour water by touching a coaster. Copper tape connected to a capacitive touch sensor is placed on the coaster. A servo motor is attached to a small container next to the cup. When the cup touches the copper tape, the servo tilts the container to pour water into the cup.

### Sketch 4: Rotary Snack Selector

This design allows users to choose snacks by turning a knob. A rotary encoder is placed on the front of the box, while a servo motor is installed underneath a circular platform holding different snacks. When the user turns the knob, the servo rotates the platform to bring the selected snack toward them.

### Sketch 5: Joystick-Controlled Snack Bowl

This design allows users to control a small snack bowl using a joystick. The joystick is placed outside the box, and a servo motor is installed inside to move the bowl through a sliding mechanism. When the user pushes the joystick upward, the bowl carrying a cookie moves out of the box. When the joystick is pulled downward, the bowl moves back inside.


**\*\*\*What questions do these sketches raise? What do you need to physically prototype to answer them?\*\*\***


### Questions Raised by the Sketches and Physical Prototyping Needs

**Sketch 1: Wave to Open a Snack Box**

- **Questions:** Can the gesture sensor reliably detect hand movements? Is the servo strong enough to open and close the box lid?
- **Physical Prototyping:** We need to test different sensor positions and build a cardboard lid to see whether the servo can open it smoothly.

**Sketch 2: Hand-Activated Candy Dispenser**

- **Questions:** Can the distance sensor accurately detect a hand underneath the box? How can we control the number of candies released?
- **Physical Prototyping:** We need to test the sensor's detection range and build a simple cardboard gate to see if candies can fall out without getting stuck.

**Sketch 3: Touch-Activated Water Pourer**

- **Questions:** Can the touch sensor reliably detect user input? Can the servo tilt the container at the right angle without spilling water?
- **Physical Prototyping:** We need to test the touch sensor with copper tape and build a cardboard support to test the tilting mechanism using an empty container first.

**Sketch 4: Rotary Snack Selector**

- **Questions:** Can the servo rotate the platform accurately to the selected snack? Can the platform support the weight of different snacks?
- **Physical Prototyping:** We need to build a cardboard rotating platform and test whether the servo can rotate it smoothly and stop at the correct positions.

**Sketch 5: Joystick-Controlled Snack Bowl**

- **Questions:** How can the servo's rotational movement be converted into the bowl's forward and backward movement? Will the bowl remain stable while moving?
- **Physical Prototyping:** We need to build a simple cardboard sliding mechanism and test whether the servo can move the bowl in and out without tipping it over.



**\*\*\*Pick one design to prototype and explain why.\*\*\***


### Selected Design: Wave to Open a Snack Box

We decided to prototype **Idea 1: Wave to Open a Snack Box** because it transforms a familiar dining experience into a more playful and interactive one. Instead of opening a snack box manually, users can simply wave their hands, making the interaction feel more engaging and fun.

We are also interested in exploring how touchless gestures can be used to interact with everyday objects. Additionally, the design has a relatively simple physical structure, allowing us to focus on testing the gesture sensor and the servo-controlled lid.

Through this prototype, we hope to explore how sensing and physical movement can make an ordinary activity more enjoyable.


**\*\*\*Document your rough prototype with photos and/or video.\*\*\***


### Prototype Documentation

We built a low-fidelity prototype of our gesture-controlled snack box using cardboard, a gesture sensor, and a servo motor.

The video below demonstrates our prototype and how the box responds to hand gestures.

The photos show the physical structure of my Snack Bot from different angles, including the open and closed states, the sensor placement, and the mechanism used to move the lid.


#### 3. Sensing and Actuation Interaction

The following sketch illustrates how sensing and actuation are connected in my Snack Bot prototype.

![Sensing and Actuation Interaction Sketch](./lab42.jpg)

When the user waves their hand above the gesture sensor, the APDS-9960 detects the movement and sends the gesture data to the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi interprets the gesture and sends a control signal through the Servo pHAT to activate the servo motor. The motor rotates to lift the candy box lid, allowing the user to access the candy without touching the box. Once the box is open, the user can wave their hand again. The gesture sensor detects the new gesture, and the Raspberry Pi triggers the servo motor to rotate back to its original position, closing the box. 

#### 4. Iterations and Testing

##### Iteration 1: Sensor Connection

At first, I had trouble connecting the gesture sensor to the Raspberry Pi. The sensor light was on, but the Raspberry Pi could not detect it through I2C. I tried different Qwiic cables and connection ports, but it still did not work.

I spent a lot of time checking the hardware connection and restarting the Raspberry Pi. After several attempts, I finally got both the gesture sensor (0x39) and Servo pHAT (0x40) detected at the same time.

I learned that even when a sensor has power, it doesn't mean the sensor is communicating correctly.

##### Iteration 2: Gesture Interaction

My original idea was to swipe up to open the candy box and swipe down to close it. However, when I attached the gesture sensor to the box, its orientation was different from how I had tested it before. The gesture direction became reversed when I used it on the actual box.

So I changed the code to make swiping down open the box and swiping up close it. This made the interaction work correctly with the actual sensor position.

I realized that sensor placement can directly affect how the user interacts with the device.

##### Iteration 3: Servo Motion


I tested many different servo angles to find a good movement for opening and closing the box. At first, I used a smaller range, but the servo arm did not move enough for my physical design.

I tried different angles manually and observed how the servo rotated. Finally, I found that 0 to 110 degrees worked better for my box.

I also added smooth movement and a short cooldown in the code, so the servo does not move too suddenly or respond multiple times to one gesture.This made the interaction feel more predictable, since one hand gesture would trigger one clear movement of the lid. I also found it fun to see the box gradually open and close in response to my gestures, rather than moving suddenly.

##### Iteration 4: Physical Structure

Building the physical structure was more difficult than I expected. I first tried different types of boxes, including paper boxes and metal boxes. The metal box was too heavy, and it was harder to fix the servo in a stable position. I found that a lighter box was easier to work with.

I also had trouble attaching the long paper strip to the servo arm. The paper was hard to secure, and it could easily become loose when the servo moved.

I tried different ways to attach it and adjust its position. I used a wire to connect the moving parts. This helped me experiment with how the servo movement could control the lid.

I learned that even a small mechanical connection can affect the whole prototype.

#### 5. Reflection

Through this project, I learned that connecting a sensor and servo in code is only one part of building a physical interaction. At first, I thought the hardest part would be programming, but the physical structure actually took me more time. Even when the servo worked correctly by itself, it was not easy to make it move the box lid.

One thing that surprised me was how much the sensor placement changed the interaction. When I attached the sensor to the box, I had to reverse the gesture directions in my code. I also found that the weight of the box and the way I attached the paper strip made a big difference. A heavier box was harder to work with, and the servo connection was not always stable.

The most fun part was seeing the servo respond to my hand movement and actually control something physical. It felt different from just seeing the output in the terminal. I also learned that adjusting the servo angle and movement speed could make the interaction more natural.

If I had more time, I would improve the mechanical structure and make the connection between the servo and the lid more stable.

Overall, this project showed me how sensing, coding, and physical design need to work together to create a meaningful interaction.


### Part F: Looks Like, Works Like, Acts Like

#### Looks Like

The prototype looks like a small candy box with a movable lid. A gesture sensor is placed near the box to detect hand movements, while a servo motor is attached to control the lid. The box is lightweight and designed to sit on a table.

#### Works Like

The gesture sensor detects hand movements and sends signals to the Raspberry Pi, which controls the servo motor. The motor opens the lid when a gesture is detected and closes it when another gesture is detected.

#### Acts Like

The user waves their hand above the sensor to open the candy box without touching it. After taking some candy, they wave again to close the lid, creating a simple, touch-free interaction.
